I'm passionate about almost everything in the computer world. That world is an infinitely deep rabbit hole teaching me new things every day. I love building things and solving problems. On this website, I share my thoughts and notes about things that interest me. And maybe my content even helps you.

Found an error? Don't hesitate and contact me. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

## Gruvbox Theme

I am the author of the Hugo theme you see. It uses the [gruvbox](https://github.com/schnerring/hugo-theme-gruvbox) color palette. If you like it, you're free to use it, too. [The code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/schnerring/hugo-theme-gruvbox) and licensed under MIT. [Have a look at the demo site](https://hugo-theme-gruvbox.schnerring.net) to explore its features.

## Analytics

I self-host [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), an open-source, privacy-respecting, and lightweight website analytics tool. I don't collect any personal data.

I use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) to host Plausible. Check my [Terraform configuration for Plausible](https://github.com/schnerring/infrastructure/blob/main/plausible.tf) if you want to learn how.
