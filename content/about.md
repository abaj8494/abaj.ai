I code by day and toy around with computers by night...

## The Theme

I am the author of the theme. You're free to use it, too. [The code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/schnerring/hugo-theme-gruvbox) and licensed under MIT. [Have a look at the demo site](https://hugo-theme-gruvbox.schnerring.net) to explore its features.

## Analytics

I self-host [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), an open-source, privacy-respecting, and lightweight website analytics tool. I don't collect any personal data.
