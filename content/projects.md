## Gruvbox Theme

I am the author of the Hugo theme you see. It uses the
[gruvbox](https://github.com/schnerring/hugo-theme-gruvbox) color palette. If
you like it, you're free to use it, too.
[The code is available on GitHub](https://github.com/schnerring/hugo-theme-gruvbox)
and licensed under MIT.
[Have a look at the demo site](https://hugo-theme-gruvbox.schnerring.net) to
explore its features.
